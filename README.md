Simply write and enter your guess! If the stat is red (like apg), your guess has a higher average than the correct player does. 
If the stat is blue (like ppg, rpg and fg%), then the correct player has a higher average than your guess. If the stat is green,
your guess has the exact same average as the correct player.

Have fun!

Note, when writing your guess, a useful popup will recommend players you to enter. When you hit enter on your keyboard, the first name on the popup will be submitted as your guess.
